Part 1: Web Scraper
===================
  This script will search the jobsatosu site for jobs matching a specified keyword. The first 30 relevant jobs
will be printed to the console in a neatly formatted table. The script will then prompt the user to quit or
execute an additional query.

Included Files:
-------------------
  SearchForJob.sh

Usage instructions:
-------------------
  Ensure the "SearchForJob.sh" file has execution permissions (chmod if necessary)
  It is recommended to run the terminal in windowed full-screen to ensure proper formatting of the results
  Run "./SearchForJob.sh"
  When prompted, type a word or phrase related to the job you are seeking (Alphanumeric characters only!)
  Note: The results contain line items "related" to the search keyword. They do not necessarily contain the
    keyword in the title.
  When prompted type "q" to quit, or anything else to rerun the script
